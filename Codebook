# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The r code finishes the following data processing:
	1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
  5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
For the final data after cleaning, there are two columns to describe the info:
  1. ID: the ID of the trainers.
  2. Activity: the Activiy performed by the trainer.
  
The left columns denotes the mean values and standard deviations of the labels in the features.txt
